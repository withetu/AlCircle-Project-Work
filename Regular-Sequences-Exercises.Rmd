#if 
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2,c=3,d=4) 
#What is the output for the code:
seq(5,11,along.with =x)

#If 
x= seq(4,12,4)
#what is the output for the code: 
rep(x,each=2)

#What is the output for the code: 
seq(5,11,by=2,length.out=3)

#What is the output for the code: 
rep(letters[1:10],3)

#Create a sequence with values: 
c(100,  95,  90,  85,  80,  75,  70,  65,  60,  55,  50)
seq(100,50,by=-5) 

#What is the output for the code: 
seq(10,0,by=5)

#What is the output for the code: 
seq(2,10,by=4)==c(2,6,10)

#What is the output for the code: 
rep(c('seq','rep'),each=4)

#Consider two vectors, A and B,
A= as.Date("2016-11-01")
B = as.Date("2016-11-15")
#What is the output for the code: 
seq.Date(A,B, by = "1 day")

#Consider two vectors, C and D,
C= as.Date("2016-02-01")
D = as.Date("2016-06-15")

#What is the output for the code: 
seq.Date(D,C, by = "-1 month")

```
