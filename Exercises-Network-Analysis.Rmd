#Load the data and create an unweighted directed graph from the adjecancy matrix. Name the nodes as letters A to Y. Set node color to yellow and shape to sphere. Set the edge’s color to gray and arrow size to 0.2.

#Plot the graph.

#Calculate network diameter and average closeness.

#Calculate average network betweenness.

#Calculate network density and average degree.

#Calculate network reciprocity and average transitivity.

#Calculate average eccentricity of the vertices. What is the average distance between two nodes?

#Find the hubs and plot graph with node’s size according to their hubs index. Which employee is the biggest hub?
