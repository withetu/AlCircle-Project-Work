flights <- read.csv("2008.csv")

#Print the structure of the data. What do you think about it?
str(flights)

#Print the summary statistics of the data. What do you think about the values? (format, consistency, completeness)
summary(flights)

#Print the dimensionality of the data (number of rows and columns)
dim(flights)

#Print the number of rows. This may seem like a silly command, but it is quite useful for loops and if statements.
nrow(flights)

#Print the number of columns.
ncol(flights)

#Print the names of the variables.
names(flights)

#Print whether the first column has missing values (NAs). Try to answer this question with two ways. Hint: %in%
match(TRUE,is.na(flights[1]),nomatch = FALSE)
#OR
TRUE %in% is.na(flights[1])

#Print the number of variables that contain missing values.
count <- 0
for(i in 1:ncol(flights)){
    if(match(TRUE, is.na(flights[i]), nomatch = FALSE)){
        count <- count+1
    }
}

# OR

count <- 0
for (i in 1:ncol(flights)){
  if( TRUE %in% is.na(flights[i])){
    count <- count+1
  }
}

print(count)

#Find the portion of the variables that contain missing values. What do you think about it?
count/ncol(flights)

#Print the names of the variables that contain missing values.
name <- c()
for (i in 1:length(flights)){
    if(match(TRUE, is.na(flights[i]), nomatch = FALSE)){
        nama <- append(name, names(flights[i]))
    }
}

```
