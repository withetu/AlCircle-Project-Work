#The repeat{} loop processes a block of code until the condition specified by the break statement, (that is mandatory within the repeat{} loop), is met.
#The structure of a repeat{} loop is:
#repeat {
#commands
#if(condition) {
#break
#}
#}
#For the first exercise, write a repeat{} loop that prints all the even numbers from 2 – 10, via incrementing the variable, “i <- 0“.
i <- 0
repeat
{
    i =i+2
    print(i)
    if(i==10){
        break
    }
}

#Using the following variables:
#msg <- c("Hello")
#i <- 1
#Write a repeat{} loop that breaks off the incrementation of, “i“, after 5 loops, and prints “msg” at every increment.
msg<-c("Hello")
i<-1

repeat
{
    i =i+1
    print(msg)
    if(i>5){
        break
    }
}

#while() loop will repeat a group of commands until the condition ceases to apply. The structure of a while() loop is:
#while(condition) {
#commands
#}
#With, i <- 1, write a while() loop that prints the odd numbers from 1 through 7.
i<-1
while(i<8){
    print(i)
    i=i+2
}

#Using the following variables:
#msg <- c("Hello")
#i <- 1
#Write a while() loop that increments the variable, “i“, 6 times, and prints “msg” at every iteration.
msg<-c("Hello")
i<-1
while(i<6){
    print(msg)
    i=i+1
}


#The for() loop repeats commands until the specified length of the condition is met. The structure of a for() loop is:
#for(condition) { commands }
#For example:
for(i in 1:4) {
print("variable"[i])
}

for(i in seq("variable")) {
print(i)
}

for(i in seq_along("variable")) {
print("variable"[i])
}

for(letter in "variable") {
print(letter)
}
#For this exercise, write a for() loop that prints the first four numbers of this sequence: x <- c(7, 4, 3, 8, 9, 25)
x <- c(7, 4, 3, 8, 9, 25)
for(i in 1:4){
    print(x[i])
}
 
#For the next exercise, write a for() loop that prints all the letters in y <- c("q", "w", "e", "r", "z", "c").   
y <- c("q", "w", "e", "r", "z", "c")
for(letter in y){
    print(letter)
}
 
#The break statement is used within loops to exit from the loop. If the break statement is within a nested loop, the inner loop is exited, and the outer loop is resumed.
#Using i <- 1, write a while() loop that prints the variable, “i“, (that is incremented from 1 – 5), and uses break to exit the loop if “i” equals 3.   
i <- 1
while(i<5){
    i=i+1
    if(i==3)break
    print(i)
}

#Write a nested loop, where the outer for() loop increments “a” 3 times, and the inner for() loop increments “b” 3 times. The break statement exits the inner for() loop after 2 incrementations. The nested loop prints the values of variables, “a” and “b“.
for(a in 1:3)
{
    for(b in 1:3)
    {
        print(c(a,b))
        if(b==2)
        break
    }
}

#The next statement is used within loops in order to skip the current evaluation, and instead proceed to the next evaluation.
#Therefore, write a while() loop that prints the variable, “i“, that is incremented from 2 – 5, and uses the next statement, to skip the printing of the number 3.
i<-1
while(i<5)
{
    i<-i+1
    if(i==3){
        next
    }
    print(i)
}

#Finally, write a for() loop that uses next to print all values except “3” in the following variable: i <- 1:5
i<-1:5
for(val in i)
{
    if(val==3){
        next
    }
    print(val)
}
