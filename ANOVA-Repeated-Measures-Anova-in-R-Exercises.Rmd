#Generate descriptive statistics for the sex variable which is a between subjects factor
#Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Together with simple graphics analysis, they form the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis of data.
#get descriptive statistics across the diet variable
if(!require(psych)){
    install.packages("psych")
}

#Generate descriptive statistics for the treatment level variable which is a between subjects factor
#get descriptive statistics across exercise type
describeBy(pulse, exertype)

#Generate descriptive statistics for the weeks variable which is the within subjects factor
#get descriptive statistics across time points
describeBy(pulse, time)

#Use histograms to assess distribution across within subjects factor.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(exercises,aes(x=pulse)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3,aes(y=..density..)) + facet_grid(. ~ time) + geom_density(col=3)

#Perform a repeated measures analysis with only the within subjects factor
#function ezAnova is one of the ways we can do repeated measures
#we will use library ez, so you need to install it
